**Getting started with Phaser**

We'll soon make a list of some good beginner tutorials for Phaser.
In the mean time, this official tutorial is a good start (both v3 and v2/CE)

Wondering if you should use Phaser 3 or Phaser 2/CE? @WiLD#4832 has a nice video on that:

In short, v3 has the fanciest new features, but v2/CE has better docs, tutorials, and community content.
